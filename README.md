# Data Engineering Capstone Project

## Scope of Works
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various skills associated with data engineering projects. In particular, developing ETL pipelines using Airflow, constructing data warehouses through Redshift databases and S3 data storage as well as defining efficient data models e.g. star schema. As an example I will perform a deep dive into US immigration, primarily focusing on the type of visas being issued and the profiles associated. The scope of this project is limited to the data sources listed below with data being aggregated across numerous dimensions such as visatype, gender, port_of_entry, nationality and month.
